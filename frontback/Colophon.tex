\noindent
This document was typeset with \LaTeX, using a blend of
\texttt{classicthesis} developed by Andr{\'e} Miede and \texttt{tufte-latex},
which is based on Edward Tufte's \emph{Beautiful Evidence}. The design was also
inspired by the PhD theses of Aaron Turon and Christian A. Larsson. Most of the
graphics in this thesis were generated using \texttt{pgfplots} and
\texttt{pgf/tikz}.
